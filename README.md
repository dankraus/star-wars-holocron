Star Wars Holocron News
===========================

Simple Star Wars News webapp built with AngularJS and Rails.


Pulls in RSS feeds for TheForce.net Rebelscum.com StarWars.com and Yakface.com via `rake feed_sync:all`

Also integrates Twitter posts of notable Star Wars sources and people in the Star Wars community.

I really just wanted one place to pull in Star Wars news and Star Wars related Tweets into one place. Build for myself and a friend and fellow fan in mind. It was also a reason to do some playing with Angular.
